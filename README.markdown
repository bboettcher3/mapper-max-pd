mapper
=========

MAXMSP and PureData objects instantiating libmapper devices. Help patches for MaxMSP and PureData are included for documentation.

This software is licensed with the GPLv3; see the attached file
COPYING for details, which should be included in this download.

To build, you will first need to install [libmapper][1] and [liblo][2] from their respective repositories. An installation of liblo <= v0.26 is not sufficient, as libmapper depends on new functionality in the library.
